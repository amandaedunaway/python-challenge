Module 3 Challenge: PyPoll

The “main.py” Python script analyzes voters' choices in an election. The script reads the .csv file and scans the data to return the candidate names and the election results. Election results include the total number of votes in the election, the count of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winning candidate.


Comments about the code:
Both Sharon and the BCS "Hints" section mentioned using dictionaries. However, I chose to stick to lists only.


Sources:
Beyond class notes for "len()", "index()", "append()", etc., I received help from Sharon, a BCS tutor, on 12/8. We primarily worked on the code for PyBank. At the end of my session, she gave me a few hints on how to proceed with PyPoll. The hints included using a for loop to count the votes and using "not in" when tracking candidate names. Both her guidance with PyBank and her hints for PyPoll made my time programming and the resulting code much more efficient than it would have been otherwise, if I had followed only what I had written for the pseudocode.
