Module 3 Challenge: PyBank

The “main.py” Python script analyzes several years of monthly profit data for a company. The script reads the .csv file and utilizes variables and lists with nested for/if loops to return several high-level pieces of information. Results of the financial analysis include the total number of months in the dataset, the net total profit, the monthly change in profit, the average change in profit, and the greatest increase and decrease in profit.

Beyond class notes, I received help from Sharon, a BCS tutor, on 12/8. She helped me efficiently name and initialize the variables and lists properly and create the nested for and if loops. I had used “with open(file_path, ‘r’)...” more times than necessary. She also showed me that I could easily print the results with an fstring and triple quotation marks, rather than using the “print” command on multiple lines, as I had originally done. Finally, I had not successfully written the output to a txt file without her guidance.
